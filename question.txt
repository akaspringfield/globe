Here's what we would like you to do for the coding challenge:

Build a small react app which shows a list of countries in a continent. 
You should make use of the following graphql endpoint: 
https://countries.trevorblades.com/
The app should have two pages:
Continent selection page: 
This page should have a select dropdown input that allows the user to select 
from a list of all continents.
Countries list page: 
A link that takes you back to the selection page
Continent information of the selected continent
Name of the continent and the continent code

List of grid of countries, where each country detail includes

Name
Currency
Capital
Languages

Overall requirements
The provided solution should follow good frontend practices (UI design and code).
Routing should be used to allow linking to a specific continent's result page
Usage of 3rd party UI and component libraries is allowed.
Usage of typescript and appropriate type annotation on graphql responses is strongly recommended.
Please deliver the code as a public Github repository. 
Try to describe in a README.md file what the project does and how to run it. 
Deploying the app and sharing a link to it is also encouraged. 


Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. 
I look forward to your solution. Good luck!
